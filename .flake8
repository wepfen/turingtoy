# - E203 (Whitespace before â€˜:') incompatible with black
# - E501 is the default line length check, which is replaced by B950
# - W503 (Line break before binary operator) incompatible with black
# - S322 The input method in Python 2 will read from standard input, evaluate and run
#     the resulting string as python source code. This is similar, though in many ways worse,
#     then using eval. On Python 2, use raw_input instead, input is safe in Python 3.
# - ANN001 Missing type annotation for self in method1
# - ANN401 Dynamically typed expressions (typing.Any) are disallowed
# - ANN102 Missing type annotation for cls in classmethod1
# - C901 Function is too complex
# - PT012 pytest.raises() block should contain a single simple statement
# - S607 Starting a process with a partial executable path
# - S603 subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input.
# - S404 Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module.

# - B008 raises a warning when we call a function to define default argument values.
#   This is what we do for typer Option and Argument, so we ignore B008 on files
#   defining CLI commands.
# - S101 (Use of assert detected...) is disabled on test source files because they use assert
